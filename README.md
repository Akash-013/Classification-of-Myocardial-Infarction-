# Classification-of-Myocardial-Infarction-
Business Objective: Myocardial Infarction(Commonly known as “Heart attack”)  is one of the most challenging problems of modern medicine. Developed the model to predict the lethal outcome based on different criteria.

Used EDA techinques to analyse the data visually. 
Handled all null values in the dataset by filling null values with the mode. 
Used Feature Engineering to balance the unbalanced dataset.
Classification Models used:
> Logistic Regression
> Random Forest Classifier
> K-Nearest Neighbor
> Extreme Gradient Boost
> Bernoulli Naive Bayes
> Decision Tree Classifier
> Stochastic Gradient Decent
> Support Vector Classifier

Here we can see that the Random Forest Model is giving high accuracy score of 98.25%. So, we can finalize this model for further deployment.
